# EinsteinDBGPT

## Description
EinsteinDBGPT is a powerful AI language model trained on the EinsteinDB, MilevaDB, FIDel, and VioletaBFT projects. It can generate text based on prompts related to these projects, providing detailed descriptions, technical explanations, and more.

## Features
- Generate text based on user prompts related to EinsteinDB, MilevaDB, FIDel, and VioletaBFT
- Provide detailed descriptions of the projects' architecture, components, and functionalities
- Create technical explanations and examples for using EinsteinDB, MilevaDB, FIDel, and VioletaBFT
- Support for multiple programming languages and frameworks

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/EinsteinDBGPT.git
  ```
2. Install the required dependencies:

  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Usage
1. Import the EinsteinDBGPT module:
  ```python
  from einsteindbgpt import EinsteinDBGPT
  ```
2. Create an instance of the EinsteinDBGPT model:
  ```python
